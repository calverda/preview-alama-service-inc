These systems are ideal for converting garages, finishing basements, adding comfort to sunrooms, or providing supplemental cooling and heating in specific areas of your home.\n\nDuctless systems offer several advantages over traditional HVAC: they're more energy efficient, provide individual room control, install with minimal home disruption, and operate extremely quietly. Each indoor unit can be controlled independently, allowing family members to customize comfort in their personal spaces.\n\nThe installation process is typically completed in one day with minimal structural modifications required. We mount the indoor unit on the wall, connect it to the outdoor unit through a small hole, and connect the refrigerant lines and electrical. The result is immediate, efficient climate control exactly where you need it most.","features":[{"title":"Fujitsu Specialists","description":"Extensive training and experience with Fujitsu systems, the industry leader in ductless technology."},{"title":"Energy Efficient Operation","description":"Ductless systems use significantly less energy than traditional HVAC while providing superior comfort control."},{"title":"Individual Zone Control","description":"Each unit operates independently, allowing customized temperature control for different areas of your home."},{"title":"Quick Installation","description":"Most installations completed in one day with minimal disruption to your home and daily routine."}],"gallery":[],"cta":{"headline":"Get a Free Ductless Mini-Split Estimate","buttonText":"Call (516) 239-5340","buttonHref":"tel:+15162395340"}},{"slug":"indoor-air-quality","name":"Indoor Air Quality Solutions","seo":{"title":"Indoor Air Quality Systems Nassau County | UV Lights & Whole-Home Filtration","description":"Improve your home's air quality with UV lights, AprilAire filters & humidity control.

At Alama Service, we offer comprehensive indoor air quality systems including UV light purification, AprilAire whole-home filtration, and complete humidity control.\n\nOur Sanuvox UV light systems destroy biological and chemical contaminants including viruses, bacteria, mold, allergens, cooking odors, pet odors, and VOCs. Unlike standard filters that only trap particles, UV lights actually destroy contaminants as they pass through your HVAC system, providing continuous air purification for your entire home.\n\nFor homes requiring exceptional filtration, we install AprilAire Media Style filters that capture particles as small as 0.3 microns - removing dust, pollen, pet dander, and other allergens that standard 1-inch filters miss. These whole-home systems are far more effective than portable air purifiers and work silently within your existing HVAC system.\n\nHumidity control is equally important for indoor air quality. Our Honeywell TrueSTEAM humidification systems add proper moisture to dry winter air, while our dehumidification solutions prevent excess moisture that can lead to mold growth. Proper humidity levels between 30-50% create a healthier, more comfortable indoor environment while protecting your home's structure and furnishings.","features":[{"title":"UV Light Purification","description":"Sanuvox UV systems destroy viruses, bacteria, mold, and chemical contaminants in your home's air."},{"title":"AprilAire Whole-Home Filtration","description":"Advanced filtration systems that capture particles as small as 0.3 microns throughout your entire home."},{"title":"Humidity Control Systems","description":"Humidification and dehumidification solutions to maintain optimal moisture levels year-round."},{"title":"Integrated HVAC Solutions","description":"All systems integrate seamlessly with your existing HVAC for whole-home air quality improvement."}],"gallery":[],"cta":{"headline":"Breathe Cleaner Air Today","buttonText":"Call (516) 239-5340","buttonHref":"tel:+15162395340"}},{"slug":"humidex-moisture-control","name":"Humidex Moisture Control Systems","seo":{"title":"Humidex Basement Moisture Control Nassau County | Eliminate Mold & Dampness","description":"Eliminate basement mold & moisture with Humidex ventilation systems.

The Humidex system offers a proven solution that eliminates mold and dampness issues by addressing the root cause - poor ventilation and moisture accumulation in lower levels of your home.\n\nThe World Health Organization states that occupants in damp or moldy buildings have up to 75% greater risk of respiratory symptoms and asthma. The EPA emphasizes that homes designed to minimize air leakage may have higher pollutant levels without proper mechanical ventilation. The Humidex system solves both problems with a three-step process.\n\nFirst, the system expels moisture-laden air from your basement or crawl space where humidity levels are highest and mold growth most likely. This contaminated air contains moisture from foundation seepage and normal household activities. Second, fresh outdoor air is drawn into the home to replace the expelled moisture. Third, the system ventilates continuously to prevent stagnant air zones where mold thrives.\n\nThe Humidex system operates automatically through an adjustable humidistat that regulates airflow based on humidity levels. When desired humidity is achieved, the fan reduces speed and maintains optimal conditions. Installation requires minimal disruption to your home, and the system operates quietly and efficiently to provide long-term moisture control and healthier indoor air quality.","features":[{"title":"Three-Step Moisture Elimination","description":"Expels contaminated air, replenishes with fresh air, and ventilates continuously to prevent mold growth."},{"title":"Automatic Humidity Control","description":"Adjustable humidistat automatically maintains optimal humidity levels in your basement or crawl space."},{"title":"Health Benefits","description":"Reduces respiratory risks associated with mold and dampness while improving overall indoor air quality."},{"title":"Structural Protection","description":"Prevents moisture damage to foundation, framing, and stored items in lower levels of your home."}],"gallery":[],"cta":{"headline":"Eliminate Basement Moisture Problems","buttonText":"Call (516) 239-5340","buttonHref":"tel:+15162395340"}},{"slug":"smart-thermostats-zoning","name":"Smart Thermostats & Zone Control","seo":{"title":"Smart Thermostats & Zone Control Nassau County | Honeywell Installation","description":"Professional smart thermostat & zone control installation.
